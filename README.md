<!-- Project Definition: State the idea -->
SmallBoulo is an online platform that helps unskilled workers(People with manual skills but have no certificate to show for it) find jobs easily. People(Employers) make posts of the jobs they offer and unskilled workers can apply. 

<!-- Success: Measurable VS Non-measurable -->


<!-- Requirements -->

<!-- Setting up MySQL server -->

-> Make sure your local server(WAMP preferably) is running with all services running(Especially MySQL).
-> Setup MySQL(phpMyAdmin) such that, it has a username of "root"(excluding the inverted commas) and leave the password field empty.
-> Create a database called "smallboulo_db"(excluding the commas).
-> In this directory you will find a file called "small_boulo.txt"(excluding the inverted commas). Open that file and run those commands table by table to create the tables required for this project. 
-> For a better view, change the extension from small_boulo.txt to small_boulo.sql and open the file in any sql file editor.
