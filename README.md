  <strong> Setting up MySQL </strong>
<ul>
  <li>
  Make sure your local server(WAMP preferably) is running with all services running(Especially MySQL).
  </li>
  <li>
  Setup MySQL(phpMyAdmin) such that, it has a username of "root"(excluding the inverted commas) and leave the password field empty.
  </li>
  <li>
  Create a database called "smallboulo_db"(excluding the commas).
  </li>
  <li>
  In this directory you will find a file called "small_boulo.txt"(excluding the inverted commas). Open that file and run those commands table by table to create the tables required for this project.
  </li>
  <li>
  For a better view, change the extension from small_boulo.txt to small_boulo.sql and open the file in any sql file editor.
  </li>
</ul>
